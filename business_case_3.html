    <h1>Live Event Traffic Management</h1>

    <p>
      This business case focuses on optimizing the flow of vehicles and pedestrians during large-scale live events, such as concerts, sports matches, or festivals, to minimize congestion, ensure safety, and enhance attendee experience. The approach leverages real-time traffic data, road capacities, and dynamic rerouting to manage inflows/outflows, prioritize emergency vehicles, and adapt to changing conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>
      Live Event Traffic Management involves coordinating vehicle and pedestrian flows in a road network surrounding event venues to prevent congestion and ensure safety. The road network is modeled as a directed graph, where nodes represent intersections or zones (e.g., parking lots, entrances) and edges represent roads with capacity constraints (e.g., vehicles per minute). Real-time data from sensors, GPS, and traffic cameras informs dynamic routing decisions, maximizing throughput while respecting capacity limits. Algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson optimize flow by finding paths with available capacity. Prioritizing emergency vehicles requires reserving capacity or computing dedicated routes. Key considerations include adapting to sudden changes (e.g., accidents, road closures), ensuring scalability for thousands of vehicles, and maintaining safety by avoiding bottlenecks and crowd surges. Effective traffic management reduces delays, enhances accessibility, and improves the overall event experience.
    </p>
    <h2>Real-Time Scenario</h2>
    <p>
      During a Super Bowl event in Chicago, thousands of vehicles converge on the stadium from multiple highways, while pedestrians stream toward entrances. The traffic management system models the road network as a graph, with intersections as nodes and roads as edges, each assigned a capacity limit (vehicles per minute). Real-time data from sensors and GPS feeds into the system, which computes optimal traffic flows and routes, directing vehicles to underutilized roads or parking zones to prevent congestion. For instance, as heavy traffic builds on main highways, the system reroutes vehicles to secondary roads, ensuring smoother flow. Emergency vehicles, like ambulances, are prioritized with reserved road capacities or faster routes, allowing rapid access to the venue. When a sudden road closure occurs due to an accident, the system instantly recomputes flows, redirecting traffic to alternative paths to avoid bottlenecks. Parking spaces are allocated efficiently based on real-time availability, and crowd surges are managed by adjusting pedestrian and vehicle flows dynamically, maintaining safety and accessibility throughout the event.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
      For Akamai, Live Event Traffic Management can be adapted to optimize digital traffic during high-demand online events, such as live-streamed concerts or sports broadcasts, while also supporting physical event logistics for clients. Key use cases include:

    <h2>Algorithms Used</h2>
    <p>Below are the algorithms evaluated for live event traffic management, with summaries of their purpose and detailed explanations of their mechanics, followed by simplified implementations:</p>

    <h2>Ford-Fulkerson </h2>
    <p>
      This algorithm maximizes vehicle throughput in a road network by finding the optimal flow of traffic from entry points to the event venue, respecting road capacity limits, using a breadth-first search approach.
    </p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      This algorithm, using the Edmonds-Karp variant, maximizes traffic flow through a road network modeled as a graph, where intersections are nodes and roads are edges with capacity limits (vehicles per minute). It employs Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find augmenting paths—routes from the source (entry points) to the sink (venue) with available capacity. For each path, the algorithm sends the maximum possible flow (limited by the smallest capacity along the path), updating residual capacities to reflect the flow used. This process repeats until no augmenting paths remain, ensuring the maximum number of vehicles can reach the venue without exceeding road limits. In practice, this means rerouting traffic to less congested roads in real-time, such as directing vehicles to secondary routes during a festival when main roads are saturated. The algorithm also supports prioritizing emergency vehicles by reserving capacity on specific edges, ensuring faster routes.

    <h2>Min-Cut Max-Flow</h2>
    <p>
      This algorithm extends Ford-Fulkerson to maximize traffic flow and identify critical road bottlenecks that limit vehicle throughput to the event venue, aiding in congestion mitigation planning.
    </p>
    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      Building on Ford-Fulkerson (Edmonds-Karp), this algorithm not only computes the maximum flow but also identifies the minimum cut—the smallest set of roads (edges) that, if blocked, would prevent additional vehicles from reaching the venue. After calculating the maximum flow using BFS to find augmenting paths, a final BFS on the residual graph marks nodes reachable from the source. Edges connecting these reachable nodes to unreachable ones form the min-cut, highlighting critical bottlenecks, such as overused intersections or narrow roads. In a real-world scenario, this helps planners identify which roads need capacity upgrades or traffic signal adjustments to prevent congestion during events. For example, during a concert, it might reveal that a single bridge to the venue is the limiting factor, prompting temporary traffic controls or rerouting strategies.

    <h2>Inference</h2>
    <p>
      For Live Event Traffic Management, Ford-Fulkerson (Edmonds-Karp) is the recommended algorithm. It excels in optimizing dynamic traffic flow by maximizing vehicle throughput while respecting road capacities, making it ideal for real-time rerouting to avoid bottlenecks during events like concerts or sports matches. Min-Cut Max-Flow is a close second, offering similar flow optimization with the added benefit of identifying critical congestion points for predictive control. Ford-Fulkerson’s ability to handle live capacity constraints ensures efficient, safe traffic management for large-scale events.
